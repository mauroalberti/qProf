name=qProf
description=Calculates topographic profiles, stacked grid profiles, geological attributes.
about=qProf is a plugin for the generation of topographic, grid/band and geological profiles.
    Topographic elevations and slopes can be extracted and plotted from DEM or GPX files.
    Stacked profiles from grids/bands can be added to topographic profiles.
    Geological data, such as stratification attitude and geological traces, can be projected on the profile.
    Intersections between geological outcrops or faults can be determined.
